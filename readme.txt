Welcome to lphant, a filesharing client based on the eDonkey2000(C) network.


Visit us at
 http://not.website.yet
and
 http://sourceforge.net/projects/lphant

The official Forum is also at http://not.website.yet

Please remember that this is an early version, not all features are implemented yet,
and not everything might work as expected.

You will need Visual Studio 2003 or the .NET Framework 1.1 SDK to compile lphant. 
If you are interested in compile it under MONO or DOTGNU you can work in this task and 
let me know. We will include your changes in the next official release.

You can also compile lphant with SharpDevelop and .NET framework 1.1 SDK.
